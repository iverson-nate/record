record

Bash script to record desktop on linux x11 system using ffmpeg. ffmpeg must
be compiled with x11-grab, libpulse, x264 and any other goodies you want.

I followed the ffmpeg Ubuntu Compilation Guide:

https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu

with the following configure options:

./configure --prefix="$HOME/ffmpeg_build" --extra-cflags="-I$HOME/ffmpeg_build/include" \
   --extra-ldflags="-L$HOME/ffmpeg_build/lib" --bindir="$HOME/bin" --extra-libs="-ldl" --enable-gpl \
   --enable-libass --enable-libfdk-aac --enable-libfreetype --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopus \
   --enable-libtheora --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree --enable-x11grab \ 
   --enable-libpulse

Pulse audio will allow you to use a variety of devices including bluetooth 
headsets as your audio input. You will need to set your microphone to the 
default in audio settings window.

Usage
